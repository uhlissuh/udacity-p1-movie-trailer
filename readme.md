# Movie Trailer Website

This website displays poster images for six of my favorite movies. When the poster is clicked, the movie's trailer plays.

### How to launch

Python 2.7.x must be installed on your machine. Download the movies file folder. Use the command line to run the following command:

```sh
python entertainment_center.py
```
and a browser will launch with the movie trailer website.
